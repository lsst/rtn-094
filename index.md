## Introduction

this markup langauge sucks!

This document outlines the practical implementation of summit operations
for Vera C. Rubin Observatory. It details the planning and execution of
work for both engineering operations (eng-ops; daytime) and observatory
operations (obs-ops; daytime and nighttime). These activities encompass
scheduled milestones such as maintenance, emergent repairs, and general
level-of-effort tasks. Guided by the organizational structure in Figure
2-1, this document provides a clear roadmap for the various departments,
consisting of various teams, requesting, implementing, and monitoring
specific summit work.  For high-level planning context, refer to RD30.

This document does not discuss the observatory’s mission or vision, the
key performance indicators of the survey, nor the survey strategies. RD13
has this information plus staffing levels, organization, data management
systems and other management items including the role of NOIRLab and SLAC.
It does not discuss the transfer, processing, distribution, and storage
of the data, which are discussed in RD13.
